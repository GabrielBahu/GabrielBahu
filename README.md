Hi, I'm Gabriel.

I'm a programming student, currently studying Java.
I have little knowledge in mongoDB, HTML5 and CSS3.

I'm interested in learning new languages, such as Node.js, React, Python and SQL...
Looking for my first opportunity as a developer, being Front-end or Back-end

I'm willing to collaborate with whatever it takes!
