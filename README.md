Hello, my name is Gabriel.

I am a Back-End developer specializing in Java. I have experience with relational databases such as SQL and MySQL, as well as non-relational databases like MongoDB.

Feel free to check out some of my projects!

I am always open to collaborating and contributing to new challenges and opportunities.
